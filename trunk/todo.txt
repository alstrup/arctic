Bugs
----

Scrollbar bugs:
- Add arrows on buttons
- Buttons should move slider handle
- Buttons should auto-repeat
- Mouse wheel support for scrollbar should work across entire clip, not just scrollbar itself
- Dragable should not capture movements from scrollbars.

Other bugs:
- Hover effect does not automatically trigger on refresh (see dynamic example)

New features to consider
------------------------

Extend blocks with new APIs:
- Add hover state for ToggleButton (can be emulated with a Mutable block with buttons inside)
- Add API for text elements to set focus to them, and ask whether they have focus, and to change contents dynamically
- Add API for changing slider position after construction
- Add API for changing state of toggle button

- Make tooltip have a delay, and make sure they do not go outside the stage

- Add filling behaviour to grid

- Ability to grey-out Button, ToggleButton, Dragable (slider), TextInput, Scrollbar, etc. Can be implemented using ArcticState

- Combo-box

- Progress-bar

- Dialog

- Nice default, light-weight look for widgets

- Add horizontal scrollbar (and extend columnstack to add one if needed)

- Resizable bitmap with aspect-ratio preservation

- Calendar widget

- Simple audio/video player

Scrollbar bugs:
- Fix scrolling for Flash 7
- Remove scrollbar event handlers when scrollbar is removed
- Change scrollbar drag in Flash 9 to work outside of the window as well
- Dragable should not capture movements from scrollbars.

Bugs:
- Hover effect does not automatically trigger on refresh (see dynamic example)

Extend blocks with new APIs:
- Add hover state for ToggleButton
- Add API for text elements to set focus to them, and ask whether they have focus, and to change contents dynamically
- Add API for changing slider position after construction
- Add API for changing state of toggle button

- Make tooltip have a delay, and make sure they do not go outside the stage
- Add filling behaviour to grid

New features to consider:

- Ability to grey-out Button, ToggleButton, Dragable (slider), TextInput, Scrollbar, etc.
  Maybe by making a new Toggle-like element like ToggleButton, except that it does not capture clicks

- Scrollbar = LineStack(Button, Slider, Button);

- Combo-box

- Progress-bar

- Dialog

- Nice default, light-weight look for widgets

- Add horizontal scrollbar (and extend columnstack to add one if needed)

- Resizable bitmap with aspect-ratio preservation

- Calendar widget

- Simple audio/video player

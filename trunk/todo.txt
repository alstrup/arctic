Bugs
----

Scrollbar bugs:
- Resizing should preserve scrollbar position
- Button arrows should be 90 degrees - they are a little too narrow now

- Button hover effect does not automatically trigger on refresh (see dynamic example)

New features to consider
------------------------

- Resizable dialog

- Consider changing ToggleButton to be a MutableBlock(Button( ) ) instead
 - Add hover state for ToggleButton (can be emulated with a Mutable block with buttons inside)

- Make tooltip have a delay, and make sure they do not go outside the stage

- Add filling behaviour to grid

- Ability to grey-out Button, ToggleButton, Dragable (slider), TextInput, Scrollbar, etc. Can be implemented using 
  ArcticState, and probably a Color filter of some kind

- Combo-box

- Progress-bar

- Nice default, light-weight look for widgets

- Add horizontal scrollbar (and extend columnstack to add one if needed)

- Resizable bitmap with aspect-ratio preservation

- Calendar widget

- Simple audio/video player

    <description>Lightweight GUI framework for haXe targetting Flash 7, 8 and Flash 9</description>
    <version name="0.9.25">
	  - fix dragable block fix from last release to prevent infinite loop
	  - fix buttons inside ToggleButtons. Reported by Maxim Prokoshin
	  - add support for fixing the width of tooltips
	  - add support for reserving extra space in ConstrainWidth and ConstrainHeight
	    by using negative minimum metrics. This works such that this extra space is 
		only used if necessary.

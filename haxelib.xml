    <version name="0.7.0">Consolidation build and calcMetrics: It was difficult to keep these synchronised, so bite the bullet and consolidate them. This means that CustomBlock API has changed. Fix bug with grid: A grid is never growing. Change word wrapping text behaviour: Does not grow in height in the same way, although there are still bugs</version>

    <description>Lightweight GUI framework for haXe targetting Flash 7, 8 and Flash 9</description>
    <version name="0.8.9">
		- Fix slider to keep relative position after resize when there is no onDrag function defined

		- Reimplement scrollbar as an ArcticView, rather than custom code, beautifying in the process

		- Add general Filter block, replacing the specific Shadow block. To upgrade, change
		    Shadow(block, d, a, c, alpha)
		  to
		    Filter(DropShadow(d, a, c, alpha), block)
		  Notice the Filter block only works on Flash 8 & 9. On Flash 7, it's a no-op.

		 - Add API for repositioning dragable and sliders. To upgrade, change
		    Arctic.makeDragable(...)   to   Arctic.makeDragable().block
		    Arctic.makeSlider(...)     to   Arctic.makeSlider().block

		- Dragable and Sliders are not controllable by mouse wheel by default
		
		- Extend Button block with API to get coordinates of click inside Button block, and both
		  mouse button press and release events.
		
		- Add a repeating button wrapper to construct buttons that can auto-repeat while mouse button
		  is pressed
		 
		- Change Frame block parameter order from 
		
		    Frame(block, thickness, color, roundRadius, alpha, xspacing, yspacing);
		  
		  to
		  
		    Frame(thickness, color, block, roundRadius, alpha, xspacing, yspacing);

    <version name="0.9.21">
		- add Arctic.makeSwitch helper
		- ArcticMC.setVisible is robust against empty clips (which allows the
		  useful pattern Arctic.makeSwitch([ Fixed(0,0), Something ]) which can
		  help reserve space for something that might show up later.
		- Extend ConstrainWidth, ConstrainHeight and Arctic.fixSize to allow NOT clipping the child
		- Support leaving hover in Button as null

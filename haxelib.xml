    <description>Lightweight GUI framework for haXe targetting Flash 7, 8 and Flash 9</description>
    <version name="0.9.21">
		- add Arctic.makeSwitch helper
		- ArcticMC.setVisible is robust against empty clips (which allows the
		  useful pattern Arctic.makeSwitch([ Fixed(0,0), Something ]) which can
		  help reserve space for something that might show up later.
		- Support leaving hover in Button as null
		- Clean up the mess about clipping and ConstrainWidth/Height. These never clip. Instead,
		  introduce a new Clip block.
	</version>

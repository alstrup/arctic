If you installed Arctic using haxelib, double click the ArcticExamples.hxml
file to compile a simple example. You can also use the ArcticExamples.hxp
file with FlashDevelop and the haxefd plugin.

If you checked Arctic out from SVN, you can use the "DevArcticExamples.*" 
files instead. The only difference is that those files use relative
paths to the Arctic-files and the development ones have debugging turned on.

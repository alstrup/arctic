Bug-fixes:
- LineStack goes crazy when lots of elements go inside it
- Dragable should not capture movements from child elements, like selecting in
  TextInputs or scrolling scrollbars.
- Add API for text elements to set focus to them, and ask whether they have focus

- Change scrollbar to listen to mouse wheel
- Change scrollbar drag in Flash 9 to work outside of the window as well
- Make tooltip have a delay, and make sure they do not go outside the stage
- Add filling behaviour to grid

New features to consider, in order of priority:
  // A slider has it's own coordinate system
- Slider( totalHeight, onChange, ?initialPos, ?dragBarHeight )
   = Dragable( Handle )
- Scrollbar = LineStack(Button, Slider, Button);

- Change update to be more efficient and animate
- Nice default, light-weight look for widgets
- Progress-bar
- Add horizontal scrollbar (and extend columnstack to add one if needed)
- Resizable bitmap with aspect-ratio preservation
- Calendar widget
- Combo-box
- Simple audio/video player
